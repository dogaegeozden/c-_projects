# Introduction
Here are my c++ applications. Most of them are console based. 

## Usage 
Inorder to run this applications and see how they are working you need a compiler. My recommendation is code blocks because it's open source and available in windows/linux/mac. 

### What is compiler
Computers understand only one language and that language consists of sets of instructions made of ones and zeros. This computer language is appropriately called machine language. The binary binary code. It's a language created with base 2 number system. Ex: 0000 = 0, 0001 = 1, 0010 = 2, 0011 = 3. Or, 0 = False, 1 = True. This programming language is very hard for humans to process but easier for machines. So people created programming languages, such as C and, C++ so, developers can inspect each others code more easily. This is where compilers gets in to business. Because compilers gets your human readable code and converts it into binary code so computer can process it.

### Step 1: Download the compiler
Go to this website: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads
Follow the link to "Download the binary release" (direct link)
Go to the Windows 2000 / XP / Vista / 7 section
Look for the file that includes mingw in the name. (The name as of this writing was codeblocks-10.05mingw-setup.exe; the 10.05 may be different).
Save the file to your desktop. It is roughly 74 megabytes.

### Step 2: Install Code Blocks
Double click the installer.
Hit next several times. Other setup tutorials will assume you have installed in C:\Program Files\CodeBlocks (the default install location), but you may install elsewhere if you like
Do a Full Installation
Launch Code::Blocks

### Step 3: Running in Code Blocks
You will be prompted with a Compilers auto-detection window.
When you get the compiler auto-detection window, just hit OK. Code::Blocks may ask if you want to associate it as the default viewer for C/C++ files--I'd suggest you do. Click on the File menu, and under "New", select "Project..."
New from template window will come up.
Click on "Console Application" and hit the "Go" button.
Click next until you get to the Language Selection Dialog
You'll be asked to choose whether you want to use C or C++. Use C++. 
After clicking "Next", Code::Blocks will then prompt you with where you'd like to save the console application.
I recommend you to create a folder in your work_space. 
Enter your project name and select the path. 
Accept default settings for your compiler set up by pressing finish. 
You will face with code editing screen. Click New from top ribbon and select open. 
Select your main .cpp file and press f9 to run the application.
